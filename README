couch_orcl: A CouchDB Client for Oracle PL/SQL

-- For HTTP operations, it uses Oracle built in package UTL_HTTP

-- For JSON operations it uses PL/JSON. It is really cool stuff.
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/pljson/ 
  I am holding a mirror of the latest release from sourceforge. Not SVN trunk.
  Latest tarball.

-- Will be implemented on Oracle object types.

-- How to user connection object: (assuming you loaded the objects into your 
  oracle database and have a running couchdb instance on your localhost with
  default port)
  
  set dbms_output on;
  declare
    conn cdb_connection;
  begin
    conn := cdb_connection(host     => '127.0.0.1', 
                           port     => 5984,
                           username => null
                           password => null);
    conn.print;
    conn.test;
  end;
  /
  
  it should print the connection uri and something like this: 
    {"couchdb":"Welcome", "version":"1.0.0"}
  
-- TODO:
--- Connection through proxy servers will be implemented.
--- a document type will be implemented that can save, update, delete itself 
    from a couchdb.
