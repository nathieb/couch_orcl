couch_orcl: A CouchDB Client for Oracle PL/SQL

-- For HTTP operations, it uses Oracle built in package UTL_HTTP

-- For JSON operations it uses PL/JSON. It is really cool stuff.

  I am holding a mirror of the latest release from sourceforge. Not SVN trunk.
  Latest tarball.

-- Will be implemented on Oracle object types.
