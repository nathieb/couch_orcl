	WARNING: You cannot do an easy upgrade because of changes in the API
        Rewrote the API to increase speed and simplicity

        Parserspeed has been improved
        Object procedures are now faster due to the 'in out nocopy' directive
        Cast from json_value to json or json_list in constructor
        json and json_list can be converted to json_value with the function to_json_value.
